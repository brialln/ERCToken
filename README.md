# ERCToken
# Overview
This is an ERC20 token contract named MyToken, developed using Solidity. MyToken implements the ERC20 standard interface and includes additional functionalities for token sale and price adjustment. 
Users can purchase tokens by sending Ether to the contract, and the tokens are minted based on the specified token price. The contract owner has the ability to adjust the token price as needed.

# Features
The features includes: ERC20-compliant token contract, token sale mechanism allowing users to purchase tokens by sending Ether, and owner-controlled token price adjustment.

# Usage
To deploy the contract, compile it using your preferred Ethereum development environment (e.g., Hardhat, Remix), 
and then deploy the compiled contract to your desired network (e.g., local, testnet, mainnet). Once deployed, 
users can purchase tokens by sending Ether to the contract. Additionally, the contract owner can adjust the token price using the `setTokenPrice` function.
